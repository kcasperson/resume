# Resume
Just a readme with my resume. Keeping it simple.

# Intro
Hi! I'm Katelyn Casperson!
I'm passionate about problem solving and LOVE finding the right technology to solve each problem. Back-end engineering is my jam, but I'm always open to new challenges. I'm currently in a Big Data capstone class and I would love to begin my career in a software engineering position working with Machine Learning concepts and tackling Big data problems.

# Education

# Experience
**Software Engineer Intern** // 
Goldman Sachs, Salt Lake City //
May - Aug 2019

I built an application using Spring Boot, IntelliJ, REST API services in Java, Groovy, and JSON. I called several company-internal APIs and created new microservices within the app. I coordinated with multiple senior engineers and Vice Presidents of the company to fine-tune the app specifications.
My app saved approximately 1,400 work hours per use by automating an annual compliance certification process.


**Assistant Project Manager** //
BYU Math Dept //
April - June 2019

Helped professors build a new Linear Algebra class based in Python. Using the command line and
Python scripts I helped perfect the auto-grader. Our work resulted in a new coding-base math class now required in three majors.


**Machine Learning Research Assistant** //
BYU Computer Science Dept //
Sept 2018 - April 2019

Working with a team of graduate students, we used a CNN to explore meaning in body language. This research stretched and improved my Python coding skills.

# Service
**Women in Computer Science Club President**

I create inclusive mentoring and career-advancing activities for members of WiCS at BYU. I have focused my tenure as president to increase members’ involvement in Code Together, our premier community-building event we hold weekly. During Code Together, students eat delicious snacks, work on code in a comfortable environment, and give and receive mentorship from club leaders, peers, and software engineers from local companies such as Qualtrics and Lucid. To increase attendance by 40%, I’ve networked with faculty to put it on their class calendars, involved company sponsorship of our snacks, and interviewed and brought on 12 more club officers to help run the business of the club.

**ACM Club Finance Officer**

I kept track of club finances. I was responsible for distributing over $5000 of funding to run a 24 hr Hackathon with 200+ participants.

**Church Missionary**

I served as a missionary leader over my peer missionaries during an 18-month assignment in Louisville, Kentucky. I also ministered to families and taught the gospel of Jesus Christ.
